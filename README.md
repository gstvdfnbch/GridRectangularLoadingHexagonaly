# GridRectangularLoadingHexagonaly

The challenge this time was to develop a honeycomb grid where each item could load in a circular manner.

To achieve this, the best approach at the start would be to draw everything out and observe the patterns or look for something geometrically usable to achieve the circular loading effect. In the example, squares were used, but in practice, they are rectangles. Therefore, throughout the process, I will always consider different heights and widths, aiming to be able to use it for both squares and rectangles. This approach would also work for circles.
